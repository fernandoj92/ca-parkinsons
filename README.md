This repository contains exploratory work done by me at the Polytechnic
University of Madrid in Summer 2015. The objective is to apply cluster analysis
to data collected from Parkinson's disease patients to identify relevant
subtypes and important clinical features. A summary of my results so far is
located in writeup/parkinsons.pdf.
